# Fender Vent
This aero addition to a fender vent is meant to fit within the 45 square inch limit for the 2025 GLTC rules.
It can be printed on any 256x256 bed (or slightly smaller). I used 95A TPU with mostly default settings
on a Bambu X1 Carbon. I upped the number of perimeter walls a little, and changed the infill to 50%.
