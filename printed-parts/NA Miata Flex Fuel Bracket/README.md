# NA Miata Flex Fuel Bracket
Using the bracket designed by [DigitalSolo](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2965407) as a base, I snipped off the original mounting points and
added some to fit in my Miata's engine bay (NA, LHD). This mounts on the side of the fuse box in the
engine bay in place of the wiper fluid reservoir. You'll want a couple M6x1.0 flange bolts to attach
it. The typical Continental ethanol content analyzer will clip right in.

## Print Settings

### Notes
I upped the number of Vertical Shell Perimeters to 3. The 0.15mm layer height was definitely overkill,
but it didn't take very long to print anyway.
